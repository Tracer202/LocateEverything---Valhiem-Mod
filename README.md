# LocateEverything---Valhiem-Mod

Mod to add pins for specified locations to the map. As a solo player, I was tired of spending hours just to find the next dungeon so I made my own mod to pin them. Pins added use the ping or 'None' icon to easily differentiate between user and mod created pins.

*Note that capitalization does not matter*

Press F5 to open the terminal. This mod uses the below commands (also found by typing in help):
  1. 'List Locations' - Displays a list of all the locations in Valheim. Used for later steps/
  2. 'Locate Closest *location* - Adds a pin of the closest instance of that location to the map.
       - *location* refers to the locations listed in the List Lcoations command. These come directly from Valheim.
       - ex. 'locate closest vendor_blackforest' will add a pin for the merchant.
  3. 'Locate All *location*' - Adds a pin for every instance of that location. (Note that there can be anywere from 0-150 instances depending on type)
  4. 'Remove Everything Pins' - Removes any pins created by the mod
      - Technically it removes any pins with the None icon type (looks like a yellow ping).
  5. 'Locate EVERYTHING' - Adds a pin for every location instance to the map. 
      - Mostly added as a joke as there are usually 10,070 ish locations created. Will drop your FPS (hasn't crash my computer yet) if you open your map and zoom out, but the Remove command works well to reset it if you want to try it out.

Suggested usage: Use list lcoations to get the proper name for your desired location. Locate All to add them all to your map. Add a manual pin for the ones you're interested in visiting. Then Remove command to remove the mod added pins so only your manual ones are left over.
